      <description>During my internship period at WSO2, Inc I worked on a project to develop a CI/CD pipeline for WSO2 API Manager. The tooling was mostly done in Golang.
When we were developing the tooling we wanted to have a project initialization phase through the CLI tool. That indeed involves a lot of code generation.
In the beginning, everything was fine, we had few files and we kept them as slices of bytes and accessed them, which was totally fine.</description>
