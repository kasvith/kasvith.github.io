      <description>Load Balancers plays a key role in Web Architecture. They allow distributing load among a set of backends. This makes services more scalable. Also since there are multiple backends configured the service become highly available as load balancer can pick up a working server in case of a failure.
After playing with professional Load Balancers like NGINX I tried creating a simple Load Balancer for fun. I implemented it using Golang.</description>

      <description>Why moving to own space It&amp;rsquo;s been a while I started blogging. I started from Blogger, Wordpress and finally stopped over Medium. It was fine to use these awesome tools. But with the time I felt that moving to my own space is better for blogging.
While these platform provides a great service I wanted more control over my content. I hate ads and stuffs, paywalls and I know you do too.</description>

      <description>During my internship period at WSO2, Inc I worked on a project to develop a CI/CD pipeline for WSO2 API Manager. The tooling was mostly done in Golang.
When we were developing the tooling we wanted to have a project initialization phase through the CLI tool. That indeed involves a lot of code generation.
In the beginning, everything was fine, we had few files and we kept them as slices of bytes and accessed them, which was totally fine.</description>
